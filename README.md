# handwrittendigit_classifier


In this project, I used the MNIST dataset from TensorFlow, which contains handwritten digits, to train a neural network that classifies these digits with high accuracy.

Key features:

Built the model with TensorFlow for training and evaluation.
Used OpenCV for image processing and handling.
Utilized the MNIST dataset for training and testing.
Achieved accurate predictions for recognizing digits 0-9.
